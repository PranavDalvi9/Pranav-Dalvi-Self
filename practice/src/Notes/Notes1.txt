We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
